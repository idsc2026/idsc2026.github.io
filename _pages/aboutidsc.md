### 🌐 The Network: A Historic Collab
We are teaming up across borders to build something massive! This event is a multilateral collaboration led by <strong>Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM)</strong> in partnership with three prestigious Indonesian institutions: <strong>Universitas Airlangga (UNAIR)</strong>, <strong>Universitas Mulawarman (UNMUL)</strong>, and <strong>Universitas Brawijaya (UB)</strong>. 

**🔄 The Legacy Loop:** IDSC 2026 isn't just a one-off event; it is the **V1.0 launch** of an annual, rotating tradition! To kick off this legacy, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Faculty of Science at UPM is taking the helm as the main organizer. In the coming years, we will pass the server keys across the region—first to UNAIR, followed by UNMUL, and then UB. The map is expanding!

### 💡 The Core Directive: Mathematics & Hope
The 2026 global theme is **"Mathematics and Hope"**. We believe that connecting hope and mathematics creates opportunities for deeper insight. Ultimately, mathematics gives us the framework to understand reality, share common definitions, and use data responsibly.

For this specific competition, your main objective is **Mathematics for Hope in Healthcare**. This challenge invites students to find "Hope in Healthcare" by developing machine learning, statistical, and signal/image analysis solutions using openly available, de-identified biomedical datasets hosted on PhysioNet. It is time to hack the system for a better future!

### 🚀 System Objectives
We aren't just here to crunch numbers; we are building a community of future innovators equipped to save lives with code. The core objectives of IDSC 2026 are to:

* **Innovate & Celebrate:** Celebrate International Mathematics Day 2026 by applying mathematical concepts to real-world healthcare data challenges.
* **Build & Deploy:** Empower students to build robust and interpretable models for biomedical signal processing and medical image analysis.
* **Connect:** Strengthen academic relations between UPM (Malaysia) and the partner universities in Indonesia (UNAIR, UNMUL, and UB).
* **Hack Ethically:** Promote ethical and reproducible data science using openly accessible, de-identified datasets hosted on PhysioNet.
* **Upskill:** Develop skills in data preprocessing, validation, benchmarking, and scientific communication for healthcare AI.
