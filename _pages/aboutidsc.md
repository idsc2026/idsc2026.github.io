  <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Uniting Data, Mathematics, and Regional Talent 🌏</h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6;">
    [cite_start]The International Data Science Challenge 2026 is a strategic cross-border initiative designed to celebrate International Mathematics Day (IDM)[cite: 25].

### 🤝 A Historic Regional Collaboration
[cite_start]This event is a multilateral collaboration led by Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) in partnership with three prestigious Indonesian institutions: Universitas Airlangga (UNAIR), Universitas Mulawarman (UNMUL), and Universitas Brawijaya (UB)[cite: 26]. 

**A Legacy in the Making:** IDSC 2026 marks the thrilling inaugural launch of an annual, rotating tradition! [cite_start]To kick off this legacy, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Faculty of Science at UPM is taking the helm as the main organizer[cite: 8, 9]. In the coming years, the torch will be passed across the region—first to UNAIR, followed by UNMUL, and then UB, ensuring a dynamic and ever-evolving challenge landscape.

### 🌟 The Theme: Mathematics and Hope
[cite_start]The 2026 global theme is "Mathematics and Hope"[cite: 26]. [cite_start]We believe that connecting hope and mathematics creates opportunities for deeper insight[cite: 27]. [cite_start]Ultimately, mathematics gives us the hope to understand reality, share common definitions, and use data responsibly[cite: 27].

[cite_start]For this specific competition, our topic is **Mathematics for Hope in Healthcare**[cite: 6, 7]. [cite_start]This challenge invites students to find "Hope in Healthcare" by developing machine learning, statistical, and signal/image analysis solutions using openly available, de-identified biomedical datasets hosted on PhysioNet[cite: 28].

### 🎯 Our Mission & Objectives
We aren't just crunching numbers; we are building a community of future innovators equipped to save lives with code. The core objectives of IDSC 2026 are to:

* [cite_start]Celebrate International Mathematics Day 2026 by applying mathematical concepts to real-world healthcare data challenges[cite: 31].
* [cite_start]Empower students to build robust and interpretable models for biomedical signal processing and medical image analysis[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]Strengthen academic relations between UPM (Malaysia) and the partner universities in Indonesia (UNAIR, UNMUL, and UB)[cite: 33].
* [cite_start]Promote ethical and reproducible data science using openly accessible, de-identified datasets hosted on PhysioNet[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]Develop skills in data preprocessing, validation, benchmarking, and scientific communication for healthcare AI[cite: 35].
