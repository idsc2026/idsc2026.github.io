The challenge will be conducted fully online in two stages. Please review the competition mechanics, evaluation criteria, and official rules below to ensure your submission qualifies.

### Competition Structure

#### Stage 1: Preliminary Round (Asynchronous)
Teams must submit the following via the official portal by **25 March 2026**:
1. **Technical Report (Max 5 pages):** Must include your problem statement, dataset selection & justification, problem formulation (states, actions, rewards, etc.), methodology, implementation details, results, clinical interpretation, conclusion, and proper citations.
2. **Video Pitch (Max 3 minutes):** A recording summarizing the project and explaining how the mathematical/computational solution brings "hope" to healthcare.
3. **Code Repository (Recommended):** A link to a GitHub/GitLab repository with reproducible code, including data loading, model training, and evaluation scripts.

*A joint panel of judges will shortlist the Top 5 teams based on technical rigor, innovation, clinical relevance, and presentation quality.*

#### Stage 2: Final Round (Synchronous)
The Top 5 teams will be invited to a live online session on **11 April 2026**.
* **Format:** Live Presentation via Zoom/Webex.
* **Duration:** 10 minutes presentation + 5 minutes Q&A.
* **Presentation Focus:** Teams should emphasize clinical applicability, model interpretability, and potential real-world impact.

### Official Rules and Regulations

1. **Originality:** Plagiarism is strictly prohibited. Projects must be original work created for this challenge.
2. **Dataset Compliance:** Teams must exclusively use dataset(s) from the official Health Gym collection. The use of external datasets is not permitted.
3. **Proper Citation:** All submissions must properly cite the Health Gym paper (*Kuo et al., 2022, arXiv:2203.06369*) and any relevant methodological papers.
4. **Ethical AI Principles:** Teams must adhere to ethical AI principles, including:
   * Model interpretability and explainability.
   * Safety validation and consideration of potential harms.
   * Discussion of limitations and failure modes.
   * Responsible deployment considerations.
5. **Code Sharing:** While optional, teams are strongly encouraged to share their code for reproducibility and transparency.
6. **Late Submission:** Submissions received after the Stage 1 deadline will not be entertained.
7. **Judges' Decision:** The decision of the panel of judges is final.
8. **Team Composition:** Teams must maintain the same composition from registration through the final round.

### Technical Requirements

* **Programming Languages:** Python (highly recommended for RL implementations), R, MATLAB, or Julia.
* **Machine Learning & RL Frameworks:** Stable Baselines3, OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium, Ray RLlib, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.
* **Computational Resources:** Teams are responsible for their own computational resources. Free cloud platforms (like Google Colab or Kaggle Notebooks) are sufficient for initial prototyping.
