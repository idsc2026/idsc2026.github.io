### ⚖️ The Ground Rules

Play fair and code hard. Ensure your team follows these regulations to avoid disqualification:

1. 🚫 **No Plagiarism:** Your project must be 100% original work created specifically for this challenge.
2. 📂 **Strict Dataset Compliance:** You *must* exclusively use dataset(s) from the official Health Gym collection. External datasets are a no-go.
3. 📚 **Cite Your Sources:** All submissions must properly cite the Health Gym paper (*Kuo et al., 2022, arXiv:2203.06369*) and any relevant methods used.
4. 🤖 **Ethical AI Only:** Your models need to adhere to strict ethical principles:
   * Prioritize model interpretability and explainability.
   * Include safety validations and consider potential harms.
   * Include an honest discussion of your model's limitations and failure modes.
   * Plan for responsible deployment.
5. 🔓 **Open Source (Encouraged):** While optional, we highly encourage sharing your code for transparency and reproducibility.
6. ⏰ **No Late Submissions:** The Stage 1 deadline is absolute. Submissions received after the cutoff will not be reviewed.
7. 🧑‍⚖️ **Judges' Word is Final:** The decision of the judging panel cannot be contested.
8. 🤝 **Squad Loyalty:** Your team composition must remain exactly the same from registration through the finals.

### 💻 Tech Specs & Tools

Bring your favorite stack! You have complete freedom over your tech, but here is what we recommend:

* **Languages:** Python 🐍 (highly recommended for RL implementations), R, MATLAB, or Julia.
* **Frameworks:** Stable Baselines3, OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium, Ray RLlib, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.
* **Hardware:** You are in charge of your own compute! Free cloud platforms like Google Colab or Kaggle Notebooks are perfect for initial prototyping.
