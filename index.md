Welcome to the official portal for the **International Data Science Challenge (IDSC) 2026**! 

Organized in conjunction with **International Mathematics Day (IDM)**, this fully online event is a multilateral collaboration led by **Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM)** in partnership with **Universitas Airlangga (UNAIR)** and **Universitas Mulawarman (UNMUL)**, Indonesia. 

Connecting hope and mathematics creates opportunities for deeper insight. Mathematics gives us the hope to understand reality, share common definitions, and use data responsibly to improve lives.

### Theme & Focus
* **Global Theme:** Mathematics and Hope
* **Event Topic:** Mathematics for Hope in Healthcare
* **The Task:** Teams will use reinforcement learning, machine learning, or advanced statistical modeling to optimize personalized treatment strategies for critical conditions (like sepsis or acute hypotension) and chronic diseases (like HIV). 

### The Challenge
Participants are invited to find "Hope in Healthcare" by developing algorithms that recommend optimal treatment sequences, dosages, and timings. All teams will utilize highly realistic, privacy-preserving synthetic health-related datasets from the official **[Health Gym collection](https://healthgym.ai)**. 

By formulating sequential decision-making tasks, participants will foster regional cooperation and analytical excellence while ensuring ethical data use and model safety.

### Prizes
A total prize pool of **RM 1,000.00** awaits the top performing teams, alongside an E-Certificate of Participation for all competitors!
* **Champion:** RM 500.00
* **1st Runner Up:** RM 300.00
